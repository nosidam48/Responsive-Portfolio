    <p>Welcome to my abridged biography! While I am relatively new to coding, my 
        unique background makes me uniquely qualified to problem solve and create
        at a high level. I received a stellar liberal arts education from Lawrence 
        University. There I majored in Anthropology and Film with a minor in vocal
        music.
    </p>

    <p>In addition to my education I have also made travel a priority in my life.
        I have traveled extensively both within the United States and abroad. 
        These travels have enabled me to see the world from many different 
        perspectives. I hope to be able to bring these experiences with me into
        my explorations of coding.
    </p>
